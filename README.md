# ThatNoobSkyMod

## (Retired)
Since [ThatSkyMod](https://github.com/XeTrinityz/ThatSkyMod) already fixed the older GPUs or iGPUs issue, this mod is not going be updated again.

Just a mod for fun. Originally made to give support for more hardware.
It's just basically a copy-paste of [ThatSkyMod](https://github.com/XeTrinityz/ThatSkyMod) but not completely finished yet.

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/alvindimas05/ThatNoobSkyMod/releases/latest)
2. Download and Run `ThatNoobSkyMod.exe`
3. Click `Install Mod`
4. Launch Sky: Children of the Light like usual
